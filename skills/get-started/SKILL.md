# Get started with Comnview

Comnview is where clients review websites, pictures (screens) and PDFs by pinning comments on them. This skill checks the connection and helps the user pick a first task. It changes nothing in the account.

The user's own instructions always come first. If they ask for something specific, do that instead of this walkthrough.

## Steps

1. Call `whoami`.
   - If it fails because Comnview isn't connected, tell the user to connect Comnview from the plugin's settings and sign in on comnview.com, then stop.
   - Report, in one or two lines: the account name and what this connection may do (read only, read and reply, or full).
   - If the connection is read only, say that replying and resolving need "read and reply", and pinning comments, capturing pages, uploading and sending need "full". The user can reconnect and choose a different level.
   - If the account doesn't have AI agent access, say so and that it's managed on comnview.com. Don't mention plans or prices.
2. Call `find_projects` with no filter (newest first). Show up to five projects: name, kind (website, pictures or PDF) and open comment count if it is returned. If there are none, say so.
3. Suggest three first tasks, using real project names from step 2 where possible:
   - "Summarize the open feedback on <project>"
   - "Draft replies to the comments still waiting for me on <project>"
   - "Do a design audit of <a web address> and pin the issues"
4. Close with what to expect:
   - Replies and comments are posted as the user, and clients get the usual email.
   - You will show any reply, upload or email before you send it.
   - Deleted pages, projects and own comments go to Trash for 30 days and can be restored.
   - The connection can be removed any time in Profile > Agents on comnview.com.

## Rules

- Don't create, change or send anything in this skill.
- Report only what the tools return. Don't guess account details, project names or counts.
